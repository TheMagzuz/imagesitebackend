# imagesitebackend
This is the backend half for a site that can be used to upload images, give them tags and search for them.

The frontend half can be found here: https://github.com/TheMagzuz/VueImageSite

## NOTE
This backend site was mostly built for personal use, so it puts alot of trust in the user: The type of the file is not verified, and anyone can up/downvote any image, as much as they like, as well as freely edit the tags of the image and delete it.
